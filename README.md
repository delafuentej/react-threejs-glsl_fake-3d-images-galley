# Fake 3D Images Gallery

Explore an interactive fake-3D image slider with WebGL parallax, depth-map distortion and ultra-smooth transitions driven by custom shaders and real-time mouse input. A WebGL gallery built with **React + Vite** that simulates real depth using a combination of:

- Depth maps
- Custom GLSL shaders
- Mouse-driven parallax
- Texture displacement
- Mirrored UV mapping to avoid texture clipping

The result is a lightweight "fake-3D" effect with smooth interaction and high performance.

This project was inspired by **Victor Costa (𝘃𝘄𝗟𝗮𝗯-𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲)** course.

The images displayed in the gallery were generated using **Canva AI** prompts, obtained from the **𝘃𝘄𝗟𝗮𝗯-𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲** course.

Depth maps for the images were created either with a **custom Python script** or using [Artificial Studio Depth Map Generator](https://app.artificialstudio.ai/tools/image-depth-map-generator).

## 🎨 Fake-3D Shader Architecture

The Fake-3D Images Gallery leverages WebGL and Three.js combined with custom GLSL shaders to create an immersive, interactive 3D effect on 2D images. This architecture allows images to respond to mouse input, creating depth-based parallax and smooth real-time displacement.

### 1.Depth Map

    - Grayscale image encoding pixel distances.

    - Lighter → closer, darker → further.

    - Drives pixel displacement.

### 2.Fragment Shader

    - Displaces pixels using depth map + mouse input (uMouse).

    - mirrored() avoids tearing at edges.

    - Renders the displaced image for fake-3D effect.

### 3.Vertex Shader

    - Passes UV coordinates to fragment shader.

    - Projects mesh to screen space.

### 4.Mouse-driven Parallax

    - Pixels move proportionally to depth.

    - Closer pixels move more → realistic 3D illusion.

### 5.Render Loop & Uniforms

    - Updates uMouse each frame.

    - Shader applied to plane mesh.

    - Smooth real-time interaction and dynamic depth effects.

🧠 How the Fake-3D Works:

1. The fragment shader samples a depth map.

2. Depth values are normalized around 0.5.

3. Mouse movement is fed through uniforms (uMouse) to displace UVs.

4. The UVs are mirrored to avoid texture clipping.

5. The original texture is sampled at displaced UV coordinates.

6. The final result appears to bend reactively in pseudo-3D.
